# Optimization Techniques for DNS Blocking System: Technical Summary

## 1. Path Compression in Trie Structure

**Concept:** Optimize the trie data structure by compressing chains of single-child nodes into single nodes with compressed path segments.

**Implementation:**
- Modify the `Node` struct to include `CompressedPath` and `CompressedNode` fields
- During insertion, identify single-child chains and compress them
- During lookup, check for compressed paths first and skip node-by-node traversal when possible
- Update tree traversal algorithms to handle compressed paths

**Technical Benefits:**
- Reduces node traversals by up to 80% for deeply nested domains
- Decreases memory overhead through reduced node count
- Maintains the core trie functionality while significantly improving path traversal

**Considerations:**
- Compression should happen opportunistically during insertion
- Must handle edge cases where compressed paths partially match
- Decompression may be necessary during certain operations

## 2. Bloom Filter Pre-check

**Concept:** Implement probabilistic Bloom filters to quickly determine if a domain is definitely not in a blocklist or whitelist.

**Implementation:**
- Add Bloom filters to the `DNSFilter` structure for both blocklists and whitelists
- Configure with appropriate size and false positive rate based on domain count
- Update all domain insertions/deletions to maintain the Bloom filters
- Modify the domain checking process to perform Bloom filter checks before expensive trie traversals

**Technical Benefits:**
- Provides O(1) deterministic negative checks ("definitely not in list")
- Small memory footprint (~1.5MB for 1M domains at 0.1% FPR)
- No false negatives ensures blocking integrity

**Considerations:**
- False positive rate must be tuned based on expected domain counts
- Bloom filters must be updated atomically with their corresponding tries
- Thread-safety must be maintained during filter updates

## 3. Fine-grained Synchronization

**Concept:** Replace single global lock with multiple specialized locks for different data categories to reduce contention.

**Implementation:**
- Restructure `DNSFilter` to encapsulate related data with its own lock
- Create separate locking scopes for blocklists, whitelists, and client configurations
- Minimize lock duration by releasing as soon as data is copied
- Use read locks for lookups and write locks for modifications

**Technical Benefits:**
- Enables true concurrent operations on independent data structures
- Reduces lock contention in high-throughput scenarios
- Improves scalability across multiple CPU cores

**Considerations:**
- Care needed to prevent deadlocks when multiple locks are acquired
- Consistent lock acquisition order must be established
- Need to balance lock granularity against overhead

## 4. Memory Mapping for Large Files

**Concept:** Use OS-level memory mapping for large blocklist files rather than loading entire files into RAM.

**Implementation:**
- Add memory mapping support using the `mmap-go` package
- Create a separate loading function for memory-mapped files
- Maintain references to prevent garbage collection
- Properly unmap files during shutdown

**Technical Benefits:**
- Leverages OS virtual memory system for efficient page management
- Only actively used portions of files consume physical memory
- Reduces application memory footprint for multi-GB blocklists

**Considerations:**
- Memory mapping is most beneficial for files exceeding 50MB
- Must maintain references to mapped regions to prevent GC issues
- Clean unmapping required to prevent file descriptor leaks

## 5. Optimized Data Structures

**Concept:** Enhance memory efficiency through careful data structure selection and allocation strategies.

**Implementation:**
- Replace maps with slices for small collections (e.g., exceptions)
- Pre-allocate maps with appropriate initial capacity
- Use binary search for lookups in slice-based collections
- Implement efficient string operations with `strings.Builder`

**Technical Benefits:**
- Reduces memory overhead from small hash maps
- Decreases garbage collection pressure
- Improves CPU cache locality with contiguous memory
- More efficient string concatenation

**Considerations:**
- Trade-offs between maps (O(1) lookup) and slices with binary search (O(log n))
- Must keep slice-based collections sorted for binary search
- Initial capacity estimates should be based on expected usage patterns

## Implementation Priority

For most effective improvement path:
1. Path Compression (immediate performance gain, simple implementation)
2. Bloom Filter Pre-check (dramatic speedup for common case)
3. Fine-grained Synchronization (critical for concurrency)
4. Optimized Data Structures (incremental improvements)
5. Memory Mapping for Large Files (significant memory savings)

This prioritization balances implementation complexity against expected performance gains, addressing the most impactful optimizations first.
